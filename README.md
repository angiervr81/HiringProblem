# HiringProblem
I was giving an assignment by my profressor of algorithms: She asked that we creatie a program that will take an array and give a random value to each index(candidate).
These values indicate the skill level of each candidate.  We will interview each candidate's skill levels and based on their skill levels we will make the deicsion to hire. 
In the end we need to run the calculations of the each person that was interviewed and hired.
